# Pomodoro Timer 

This is my personal pomo tool for time management, written in Golang **not by me :)** (AI).
Build for Tmux Users Only.

Feel Free to use it.

```bash
make build-linux # Build binary /bin/pomo_linux(amd46), Add this to your environment
make build-mac   # Build binary /bin/pomo_mac, Add this to your environment
```

```bash
make build # Build both linux and mac
```
